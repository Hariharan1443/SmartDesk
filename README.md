# SmartDesk

The project "SmartDesk" is a virtual platform designed to facilitate interactive learning and collaboration among participants on various topics.
Room Creation: Users can create rooms based on different subjects, topics, or interests. They have the flexibility to choose a name for the room that reflects its purpose and content.
Topic Selection: Upon creating a room, users can select or define the topic of discussion or study. This helps in categorizing rooms and making it easier for participants to find relevant discussions.
Participant Interaction: Participants within a room can interact with each other through various means, including text chat, audio calls, video conferencing, and file sharing. This enables real-time communication and collaboration among users.
